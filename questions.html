                <dt>Q: How do I burn candles safely?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep lit candle in sight at all times!</li>
                        <li>Never burn a candle on or near anything that might catch fire, like loose papers, fabric, bedding, books, drapes, decorations, etc. Play it safe and give your candle nice clear area to sit on.</li>
                        <li>Keep lit candles away from drafts--open windows, air conditioners, vents, fans, etc.</li>
                        <li>Keep candles out of the reach of children and pets.</li>
                        <li>Extinguish the flame if it becomes too high or flickers repeatedly. Trim the wick and check for drafts before re-lighting.</li>
                        <li>If there is any chance you might doze off to sleep, blow out your candle immediately!</li>
                        <li>Wait until the flame extinguishes completely and clears of smoke before replacing our topper lid.</li>
                        <li>If you’ve created a large wax pool during your burn, blow it out gently to avoid wax splattering.</li>
                        <li>Don’t try to take a selfie while holding a lit candle (guilty…)</li>

                <dt>Q: Do you test on animals?</dt>
                <dd>A: No! All of our candles are cruelty-free and vegan.</dd>
        
                <dt>Q:How strong are the scents?</dt>
                <dd>A: We spent a lot of time experimenting and tweaking our formulation in order to get the strength just right. Feel like we went too strong or too weak? We’d love to hear your feedback and offer free returns and exchanges! Let us know at <a href="mailto:nectarwick@candles.com">nectarwick@candles.com</a></dd>

                <dt>Q: What kind of wicks do you use?</dt>
                <dd>A: We use non-bleached lead-free cotton wicks for our candles.</dd>
            
                <dt>Q:How do I know when my candle is finished?</dt>
                <dd>A: Once your candle reaches about 1/2” of remaining wax, it is time to discontinue use. Burning a candle with little to no wax left is not recommended.</dd>

            <dt>Q: How can I update my order?</dt>
            <dd>A:

            </dd>

            <dt>Q: I forgot to add my discount! </dt>
            <dd>A: We have been there before — simply email us at <a href="mailto:nectarwick@candles.com">nectarwick@candles.com/order</a> and we are happy to retroactively apply that in our backend..</dd>
    
            <dt>Q:This is a gift, can I leave a message?</dt>
            <dd>A:Gift messages are in development. In the meantime, all of our orders are treated as gifts as each package does not contain any type of receipt or pricing indication, and they are wrapped up nicely. We do recommend letting your gift recipient know to expect a package since there is no packing list included.</dd>

            <dt>Q: Where is my package — there are no updates?</dt>
            <dd>A: Most carriers need about 48 hours to continuously update the tracking information on the tracking page. Most times packages are just backlog from station to station, and are waiting to be received to make their next move. If more than 1 full week goes by from the last known scan date without an update to your tracking, please reach out to us!</dd>
        
            <dt>Q:How long do I have to make a return?</dt>
            <dd>A: From the delivery date of the package, you have 30 days to make an exchange or return. All products must be in an unused condition, sellable appearance, and unopened if seals are presented. You must email us at <a href="mailto:nectarwick@candles.com">nectarwick@candles.com/order</a> to obtain a return authorization number in order to return. You are welcome to use the same shipper box as long as the items are safely packaged for your return.</dd>
